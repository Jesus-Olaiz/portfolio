            Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a versatile full stack web developer
            adept at creating dynamic, responsive websites using a range of
            technologies. I specialize in harnessing the power of React and

            applications. Leveraging Knex, I skillfully manipulate data through
            precise query construction, ensuring seamless functionality.
